**Authors**: _Joanne Lin, Ruirui Lin, Yini Li, David Bull, Nantheera Anantrasirichai_

**Institution**: Visual Information Laboratory, University of Bristol, United Kingdom

[[`arXiv`](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01495)]

## Usage
1. Train VDP-Net
2. Collect $\Phi$ from low-light datasets 
2. Train Mask2Former-based VIS method with ELVIS (we provide GenVIS+ELVIS code as an example)

We also provide the pre-trained weights of VDP-Net and GenVIS+ELVIS [here](https://github.com/JoanneLin168/ELVIS/releases/tag/v1.0).
